Tayport FC’s New Programme Archive

Tayport Football Club has been issuing programmes for most home matches since the early 1990s and every one of these programmes plus some issued in the club’s amateur days is now available on a new website [www.tayportfcarchive.com](http://www.tayportfcarchive.com/)

It’s a comprehensive Archive of 435 programmes which have been digitised by staff at the University of St Andrews Library.

Through the medium of these matchday programmes the Archive traces the fortunes of Tayport FC during its hugely successful period in Junior Football from 1990 to the present day, playing matches against almost 100 different clubs.
It’s a period in which the club made six Scottish Junior Cup Final appearances, winning three, won two East Region Super League titles, two Premier League titles, nine Tayside Championships and thirty two local and regional cup competitions. 

It’s a veritable cornucopia of Junior football nostalgia with a good measure of community interest thrown in.

Tayport FC would be pleased to receive any comments or answer any questions relating to the Archive.

Gas distribution company SGN will shortly be starting work to upgrade the local gas supply network in the William Street area of Tayport.

The existing metal gas mains and services need to be replaced with modern plastic pipe to ensure a continued safe and reliable gas supply to the local community.

The essential work forms part of an ongoing mains replacement programme developed with the Health and Safety Executive. Following discussions with Fife Council, our project will start on Saturday 30 June and last approximately six weeks.

We’ll start our work in Maitland Street from the roundabout with Mill Lane to its junction with Queen Street. Maitland Street will be closed for the duration of our six-week project and there will be signed diversions in place for motorists.

Our second team of engineers will be working in Queen Street between its junctions with Maitland Street and William Street. We will progress northwards into William Street until we reach its junction with Castle Road. Both sections of road will be closed for the duration of our work and diversion routes will be in place. 

We will also carry out work in a section of Reform Street and the road will be closed to through traffic between its junctions with William Street and Castle Street. To ensure everyone’s safety around our work area, we will need to close Spearshill Road between its junctions with Castle Road and Dougall Street.

We may need to suspend some parking around our work area and in surrounding streets to allow continued traffic flow for motorists following diversion routes. Access will be maintained for residents at all times.

SGN Engineering Manager Lindsay Taylor said: “We’ve worked closely with the local authorities in planning this work and we will be doing everything we can to limit disruption during our essential project.

“We appreciate that roadworks can be frustrating, however, the new plastic pipe has a minimum lifespan of 80 years. This means once the work has been completed, Tayport homes and businesses will enjoy the benefits of a continued safe and reliable gas supply for many years to come.”

[What Next For Cubs And Brownies?](<a href="pdfs/2017-08-29-cubs-brownies.pdf)

The Leaders of our respective Brownies and Cub Scouts have long recognised that we have been over reliant on our neighbouring Guides and Scout troops to support the young people of Tayport in the 10-14 year age group.

It is planned to hold a meeting on Monday 25th September in the Scout Hall at 7.30pm to explore forming a Scout troop in Tayport.  We would welcome parents or anyone with a interest in this community initiative to attend.

Why a scout troop?  The Scouts are the only uniform group that welcomes both girls and boys and allows us to pool resources to provide an outlet for our young people.  It will allow those moving on from the Brownies and Cubs to the next stage of their adventure.

Please join us on Monday 25th September or if you can't join us we would welcome your input either by email or on our respective Facebook pages.

<a href="media/2017-burgh-gregory.jpg">Community Assets Transfer</a>

<strong>Derek Gray‎ to Tayport Community Council</strong>

I am pleased to report that 20 local residents (including some representing local groups/organisations) plus our three Councillors and officers from Fife Council, attended the meeting to discuss interest in setting up a working group to explore the future of the Burgh Chambers and Gregory Hall.

Lots of very relevant questions were asked and the outcome was that ten people have signed up to be part of the working group which will have its first meeting on either Tuesday 19th or Tuesday 26th September 2017 (date to be confirmed), 7.00pm at the Burgh Chambers. If anyone else would wish to join the working group, please contact me so I can advise which date is finally agreed – dek.gray@gmail.com, tel 07539 932018

I expect an early priority of the working group will be to identify how best to keep the community updated on the progress it is making.

Thank you to everyone for their interest and contributions and to Janice Laird, Fife Council’s Community Manager for North East Fife Area for her input.

Derek Gray
